# Spotify Music Game
---
ðŸŽµ A fun, interactive application that allows a user to test their knowledge of songs in their own playlists. ðŸŽµ

### Live Demo

[Click here to check it out!](https://spotify-music-game.netlify.app/)
Currently, the Spotify Web Playback SDK is unsupported in mobile and safari, so unfortunately, you won't hear the tracks on those platforms. You can still visually check out the app's functionality, but to hear the tracks playing, you'll need to use Chrome or Firefox or Edge on a computer.

### Instructions
- Log in the Spotify link
- You will see your current score at the top and a list of your playlists below
- Click on a playlist to start a 'guess the artist' game
- Wrong answers for each question are populated from other artist info from that playlist
- Game ends when playlist is over or you hit three wrong guesses
